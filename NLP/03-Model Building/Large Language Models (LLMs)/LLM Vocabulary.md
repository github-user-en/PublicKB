- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: stemmed from the field of Information Retrieval where people wanted to search/retrieve data/information using Natural Language, instead of using SQL. The field grew to give birth to several sub-fields:
	- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: aims at understanding human natural language input into machine understandable instructions.
	- **Natural Language Generation (NLG):** interested in making machines write like humans. This gave birth to generative models for next word/token prediction. 
		- **Statistical Models:** such as Markov Chain models.
		- **Deep Learning Models:** LLMs are an example of a Deep Learning model for NLG. Initial Language Models (such as T5) were encoder-decoder models. Today, most LLMs are decoder only models.
		 		- **Base Model / Pre-trained Model:**
