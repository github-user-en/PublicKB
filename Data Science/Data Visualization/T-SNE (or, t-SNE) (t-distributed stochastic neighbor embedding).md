t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a statistical method for visualizing high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map.

## t-SNE Algorthm Stages
t-SNE comprises two main stages: 
1. constructing a probability distribution over pairs of high-dimensional objects and defining a similar probability distribution over the points in the low-dimensional map. 
2. Then, minimizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the two distributions.

## Applications
t-SNE has been used for visualization in genomics, computer security research, natural language processing, music analysis, cancer research, bioinformatics, geological domain interpretation, and biomedical signal processing.
