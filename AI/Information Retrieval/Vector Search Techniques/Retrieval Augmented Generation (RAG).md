In Native RAG, the user query is processed through a pipeline that includes retrieval, reranking, synthesis, and generation of a response. This process leverages retrieval and generation-based methods to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers.

Agentic RAG is an advanced, agent-based approach to answering questions over multiple documents in a coordinated manner. It involves comparing different documents, summarizing specific documents, or comparing various summaries. 
 
Agentic RAG is a flexible framework that supports complex tasks requiring planning, multi-step reasoning, tool use, and learning over time. 
 
𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 
- Document Agents: Each document is assigned a dedicated agent capable of answering questions and summarizing within its own document. 
 - Meta-Agent: A top-level agent manages all the document agents, orchestrating their interactions and integrating their outputs to generate a coherent and comprehensive response. 
 
𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗕𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗳𝗶𝘁𝘀 
- Autonomy: Agents act independently to retrieve, process, and generate information. 
 - Adaptability: The system can adjust strategies based on new data and changing contexts. 
 - Proactivity: Agents can anticipate needs and take preemptive actions to achieve goals. 

**Applications**
Agentic RAG is particularly useful in scenarios requiring thorough and nuanced information processing and decision-making.
