Sometimes, colours can be distinguishing features, and so, can be used fed as features to ML models. However, instead of using relative colour features, such as RGB; use absolute color features provided by the LAB space. The LAB space features are a powerful tool to differentiate and classify your data, based on colours, with surgical precision.

To understand the LAB color (and how, being an absolute color space, it is a device independent color space), see this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bY8MVHf0JM
