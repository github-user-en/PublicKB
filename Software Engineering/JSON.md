JSON is a lightweight data format for data interchange that can be easily read and written by humans, and easily parsed and generated by machines. It is a complete language-independent text format. 

The syntax of JSON is considered a subset of the syntax of JavaScript including the following:
- **Name/Value pairs:** Represents Data, the name is followed by a colon(:), and the Name/Value pairs are separated by a comma(,).
- **Curly braces:** Holds objects.
- **Square brackets:** Hold arrays with values separated by a comma (,).

**Keys/Name** must be strings with double quotes. 

**Values** must be data types amongst the following: 
- String
- Number
- Object (JSON object)
- Boolean
- Null
- Array (use the square brackets `[]`)

Python objects and their equivalent conversion to JSON:

| Python      | JSON Equivalent |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| dict        | object          |
| list, tuple | array           |
| str         | string          |
| int, float  | number          |
| True        | true            |
| False       | false           |
| None        | null            |
